    <h4>Project 1 - Designed a wash down station
        in Cape York, Australia</h4>
        <h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Duration - 3 months </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Section 1 - Analysed the weed situation in Cape York. </li>
            <li>Section 2 - Analysed the set of criteria and constrained formed
                by the stakeholders</li>
            <li>Section 3 - The final conceptual design was made using AutoCAD, Solid Works & Sketch-up.</li>
            <li>Section 4 - A full explanation of the proposed design was
                presented</li>
        </ul>

        
    <h4>Project 2 - Designed an automated open
        sun dryer for food
        </h4>
        <h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Duration - 4 months </li>
                
            </ul></h4>

       <p>
        The project was to design an automated sun dryer for food to
        mitigate the damage that can be caused by unexpected rains. The
        team had four members, and four designs were introduced. Selected
        a final design and improved it using Solid Works & Sketch-up
       </p>

       <h4>Project 3 - Designed a wall following
        robot
        </h4>
        <h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Duration - 4 months </li>
                <li>Technologies used :- C programing language</li>
                
            </ul></h4>

       <p>
        Designed a maze- solving robot that can be controlled manually
        from a mobile application. The robot was designed to avoid
        obstacles so it could follow the walls and solve the maze
       </p>

       <h4>Project 4 - Designed a line following
        robot
        </h4>
        <h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Duration - 4 months </li>

            </ul></h4>

       <p>
        Designed a line following robot that can be controlled manually
        from a mobile application. A grid ( 9x9) was made on the floor 
        using black tape and robot was programed to follow the lines.
        Identifying the junctions ( T junction etc.) and avoid obstacles 
        was also expected.
